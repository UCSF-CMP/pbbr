***"Only those who dare fail greatly can ever achieve greatly."***<br>
-Robert F. Kennedy

**The Program for Breakthrough Biomedical Research (PBBR)** seeks to stimulate and support highly innovative basic science research at UCSF. The focus is on basic science projects of *potentially high impact that are creative, risky, and transformative*. We seek novel ideas for basic science projects that are more ambitious than those that receive funding from NIH and other traditional funding mechanisms.

To date, PBBR projects have generated more than 1,500 peer-reviewed scientific publications, more than 60 patents, and more than 1.2 billion dollars in subsequent funding for its PIs. In addition, PBBR has also produced more than $200 million to support research at UCSF through indirect cost recovery, and has led to more than 300 National Institutes of Health (NIH) research grants.

The Program for Breakthrough Biomedical Research is operated at the [University of California, San Francisco](https://www.ucsf.edu/). Our administrative office is located at [UCSFâ€™s Mission Bay campus](https://www.ucsf.edu/locations/mission-bay).

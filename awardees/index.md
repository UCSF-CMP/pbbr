**Award Policies**
When awarded a PBBR grant or fellowship, funds for each period should be expended within the period as proposed. **Unexpended funds must be returned to PBBR**. Although we discourage credit balances at the end of the award period, awardees may request a No Cost Extension for 3, 6 or 12 months (extensions over 12 months are not permitted). See below for PBBR policies regarding No Cost Extension requests.Please Note: Award overdrafts are the responsibility of the PI’s department. For example, if the PI’s appointment is in the Department of Biochemistry, then the Department of Biochemistry is responsible for clearing any overdraft of the fund. Failure to clean up overdrafts can jeopardize future PBBR funding for the PI.
**PBBR Grants:**
 
The award must be applied solely to the conduct of research as outlined in your project proposal.
 
**Funds may not be used for faculty and administrative salaries, student tuition/fees, travel and food/entertainment**. These costs are specifically excluded.
 
General office supplies and telephone charges must be 100% related to the research project; expenses that appear on the general ledger will be closely audited by the PBBR Financial Analyst.
 
Salaries for graduate students, postdocs, and professional technical staff are allowed.
 
So that we can prepare annual reports for the Sandler Foundation, we will ask Principal Investigators to provide progress reports for each year of their awards.

We will also likely ask Principal Investigators to participate in a site visit by the Sandler family and their external scientific advisory committee, which occurs biennially. The next is schedule for July 2016.
 
**PBBR Fellowships:**
 
Research allowance may be used for research supplies, meetings, courses and other research expenses directly related to the proposed research and as outlined in the fellowship application. Please note the following:

* Total expenses for computer hardware cannot exceed $2,000.
* Total expenses for travel to scientific meetings cannot exceed $2,000.
* The remaining funds may be used for research supplies and courses related to the career development of the fellow.
 
**Funds may not be used for food/entertainment, student tuition/fees or payroll expenses of any kind (i.e., faculty, staff, student or administrative)**. These costs are specifically excluded.
 
 
**Acknowledgements:**
 
When publishing research supported by PBBR funds, please use the following acknowledgement: “This project was funded by the UCSF Program for Breakthrough Biomedical Research, funded in part by the Sandler Foundation.” Please also email a PDF of each publication to <pbbr@ucsf.edu>.

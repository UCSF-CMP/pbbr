**Award Policies**
When awarded a PBBR grant or fellowship, funds for each period should be expended within the period as proposed. **Unexpended funds must be returned to PBBR**. Although we discourage credit balances at the end of the award period, awardees may request a No Cost Extension for 3, 6 or 12 months (extensions over 12 months are not permitted). See below for PBBR policies regarding No Cost Extension requests.Please Note: Award overdrafts are the responsibility of the PI’s department. For example, if the PI’s appointment is in the Department of Biochemistry, then the Department of Biochemistry is responsible for clearing any overdraft of the fund. Failure to clean up overdrafts can jeopardize future PBBR funding for the PI.****

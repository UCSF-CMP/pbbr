1. **E-mail** **Kerri Santos** <kerri.santos@ucsf.edu> to obtain the PBBR parent chart string. The post-award manager for the project will then need to request a separate project ID, and utilize the PI's Department ID, to set up a unique chart string for the project.

2. Once the PI's project chart string is set up, e-mail it to Kerri Santos.

3. We will then allocate funds to the PI's project chart string. Please note: any overdraft of the award is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator’s Department. Failure to clean up overdrafts can jeopardize future PBBR funding for the Principal Investigator.


No Cost Extensions:
****

**3 months:** A request to extend funding for 3 months requires no justification from the PI. Departmental financial staff or the PI can essentially notify Jenny Banaszek of the 3 month delay in spending out the award via e-mail <kerri.santos@ucsf.edu>.

**3 – 6 months:** To request an extension beyond 3 months of the original award period, the PI should request the extension, by email or memo, addressed to Keith Yamamoto, (Director of the Program for Breakthrough Biomedical Research) but sent to Jenny Banaszek, and it should include the following information:

* Title of the project
* Award period
* Award amount
* Amount of unspent funds
* Date through which the award is to be extended
* A plan to spend out the award within the new time frame

**6-12 months**: If the extension is beyond 6 months, also give specific reasons for the delay.

**More than 12 months:** no extensions.

**PLEASE NOTE: IF A NO COST EXTENSION IS NOT REQUESTED AND THERE IS A CREDIT BALANCE REMAINING IN A FUND 3 MONTHS AFTER THE END DATE OF AN AWARD, THE CREDIT BALANCE WILL BE RETURNED TO THE PROGRAM FOR BREAKTHROUGH BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH.**

**Award Policies:**

When awarded a Program for Breakthrough Biomedical Research grant, funds for each period should be expended within the period as proposed. **Unexpended funds must be returned to the Program for Breakthrough Biomedical Research**. Although we discourage credit balances at the end of the award period, Principal Investigators may request a no cost extension for either 3, 6, or 12 months (no cost extensions over 12 months are not permitted). See above for PBBR no cost extension request policies.

Overdraft of the award is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator’s department. For example, if the Principal Investigator’s appointment is in the Department of Biochemistry, then the Department of Biochemistry is responsible for clearing any overdraft of the fund.

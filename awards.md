The Program for Breakthrough Biomedical Research offers awards in the following categories:

New Frontier Research (NFR): $25,000 to $150,000 for 1 year; supports basic science research projects at levels of risk and innovaton that substantially exceed those supported by NIH; multiple awards annually. Both individual principal investigators and co-investigators are eligible to apply. We encourage investigators from all stages in their careers to apply, and invite multiple PI projects that combine distinct research approaches to focus on a single problem; projects that span different UCSF campuses are also encouraged.

Technologies, Methodologies & Cores (TMC): $50,000-$500,000 for 1 year in matching funds; strong emphasis on invention and development of new technologies and methodologies; the establishment of technology cores and acquisition of shared instruments that will serve a broad community will also be considered. Awards will be made to both individual principal investigators and/or co-investigators, especially those that combine distinct research approaches to focus on a single problem, and conduct their work at different UCSF campuses.

New!!! Breakthrough Program in Rheumatoid Arthritis-Related Research (BPRAR): Funds awarded through this exciting new program are intended to support breakthrough, innovative basic research that is related to rheumatoid arthritis. Award amounts will be up to $100,000 for one year, with the possibility of a second year of funding depending upon results and progress during year one. Similar to the PBBR NFR awards, this program encourages high-risk, transformative basic research that is not yet ready for NIH support.

UCSF Sandler Fellows Program: The UCSF Sandler Fellows Program brings exceptionally promising young scientists to UCSF in a special capacity, in which they establish independent research programs with the sole mandate to do their best science. UCSF Sandler Fellows are small group leaders with Principal Investigator status in the University, which enables them to obtain extramural grant support to support the growth of their programs, and thus are of a special class of "Faculty Fellows" markedly distinct from traditional postdoctoral fellows. This program seeks recently graduated Ph.D.'s or M.D.'s whose potential as investigators indicates they would benefit from a sheltered independence. Institutional support is granted for five years and is sufficient to maintain a small laboratory of two to four members. UCSF Sandler Fellows enrich our interactive intellectual community with their enthusiasm and sole focus on research, and are at the same time mentored by our community. Former and current UCSF Sandler Fellows have been resoundingly successful in formulating extraordinarily creative and vital research programs. The combination of independence, singular focus, and effective mentoring facilitates the development of remarkable young scientists, who are becoming the next generation of scientific leaders, both at UCSF and in the larger biomedical research community.

Independent Postdoctoral Fellow Research Award: These fellowships are designed to encourage creative and independent research driven by postdoctoral scholars. The fellowships support UCSF postdocs who wish to explore biomedical research directions that are not directly linked to the research interests of their postdoctoral mentor and require the engagement of an additional collaborator or co-mentor. These one year fellowships consist of $15,000 research allowance for meetings, courses, or research expenses. Unlike the faculty awards, Call for Proposals for the Independent Postdoctoral Fellow Research Award go out once a year rather than twice a year.

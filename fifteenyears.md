##On May 23, 2013, UCSF hosted a celebration of PBBR's 15th anniversary at its Mission Bay campus.

A packed auditorium at Genentech Hall gathered for the event, which included a provocative panel discussion on the state of high-risk scientific research, "Unconventional Wisdom: Advancing Scientific Discovery by Breaking the Rules." Michael Krasny, host of "Forum" on KQED radio, moderated a lively talk featuring UCSF Chancellor Susan Desmond-Hellmann, Biochemistry & Biophysics professor Joseph DeRisi, Microbiology & Immunology professor Anita Sil, and Nobel laureate Alfred Gilman, former Dean of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and for many years a member of the PBBR's external advisory board. The event also paid tribute to the late Marion O. Sandler, one of PBBR's founding philanthropic partners and visionaries.

At the celebration, Program Director Keith Yamamoto announced that PBBR projects have generated more than 1,500 scientific publications, more than 60 patents, and more than 1.2 billion dollars in subsequent funding for its PIs. In addition, PBBR has also produced more than $200 million to support research at UCSF through indirect cost recovery, and has led to more than 300 National Institutes of Health (NIH) research grants.

The Program for Breakthrough Biomedical Research, or PBBR, is not your usual research program. This one is unique. It dares our scientists to dig deeper, ask tougher questions, challenge conventional wisdom, and invent novel ideas and approaches that defy the status quo. These scientists seek to advance knowledge in nonlinear ways. To have leaps rather than steps. To have forehead-slapping revelations that reveal unexpected roads to discovery.

PBBR forces rethinking. It gets people out of their comfort zone. It challenges prevailing paradigms and illuminates new pathways – conceptual and methodological. And these new discoveries are remarkable in their own right. Many of them can lead to new treatments and cures, and prevention of disease. It’s science that can be leveraged to reach transformative levels of application.

At UCSF, PBBR has produced a bold culture, one of disruptive thinking and risk taking. One that puts failure in a new light. In fact, if every PBBR grantee marched flawlessly forward, we wouldn’t be reaching high enough. One of our investigators put it well when he said, **“By creating the freedom to fail, PBBR gave us license to take bolder approaches, which, successful or not, can provide more substantial insights into biological processes in human disease.”**

This is the spirit that defines PBBR and UCSF as an institution. Another special quality about PBBR is that it’s funded entirely by private philanthropy and campus funds, not the federal or state government, like most programs. Please join us in supporting PBBR: With fast, flexible resources, we can turn unorthodox ideas into cures.
